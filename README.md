# Emscripten Experiments

## How to run
Each project (in its own directory) contains a matching markdown file that contains the notes and instructions for that project.

## Assumptions
- Emscripten has been installed
- The Emscripten binary directory is in the system's PATH so that commands like `emcc` can be called from any directory

## Tips
- Run `emcc` with the `-v` options to print debug information
